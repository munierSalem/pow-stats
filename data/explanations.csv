In-bounds,"""On Piste""","Lift-served, in-bounds, groomed and ungroomed runs.  These are marked and signed trails, typically graded and devoid of trees or with isolated stands of trees.  Examples include groomers and bump runs.",Resorts always include this acreage.,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
In-bounds,"""Off Piste""","Lift-served, in-bounds, natural or gladed terrain. These are still signed trails, and usually still maintained by ski patrol, though they may include unmarked hazards.  Examples include natural bowls, glades, chutes and gulleys.","Resorts almost always include this in their advertised acreage, though some are careful to split it out as its own category.  When we quote advertised acreage, we include the sum of these breakouts, to help put resorts on an even footing.",,Typically,Yes,Yes,Yes
In-bounds,Hike To Terrain,"Terrain is in-bounds, signed and maintained by ski patrol, but requires either hiking in or hiking out.  We also consider in-bounds terrain that requires pay-per-ride (public) snow cat, bus pickup, or other arrangements besides aerial lifts and gravity.","Resorts almost always include this in their advertised acreage, though some are careful to split it out as its own category.  When we quote advertised acreage, we include the sum of these breakouts, to help put resorts on an even footing.",,Typically,Yes,Yes,No
In-bounds,Unsigned/Unmaintained,"Terrain within the resort bounds that is not roped off, but also not maintained or patrolled.  This includes tree islands between signed runs/glades, and can also include marginal terrain like flats, boulder fields, riparian zones, etc.  Whether or not people actually ski this depends on the nature of the terrain, tree density, conditions, skier ability, risk tolerance, and resort policy.","This varies wildly by resort, but their are regional trends.  Eastern Resorts, along with Colorado and New Mexico, typically do not include this terrain in their advertised acreage.  The Midwest, Northern Rockies and Pacific regions mostly do.","We follow the resort's lead here, and include this acreage if they do.",Maybe,Yes,Maybe,Maybe
In-bounds,Roped Off Terrain,"Terrain explicitly marked on the trail map as unskiabe, or roped off by ski patrol, but still within the patrolled boundary (""admin boundary"") of the ski-area.  Skiing this is always against resort policy, typically dangerous, and often illegal.","It's unclear if some resorts are including this terrain in their advertised ""acreage.""  When we independently measure the boundary-to-boundary acreage of a ski area, our measurement is sometimes consistent with this acreage getting included.",We should go back through and exclude this?,Maybe,Yes,Maybe,Maybe
In-bounds,Private Terrain,Terrain strictly reserved for wealthy homeowners and their hangers-on.,"We only include resorts here with public access (e.g. no Yellowstone Club).  While most resorts are 100% public, Powder Mountain has introduced a hybrid model, with some areas strictly reserved for homeowners and their guests.  As of Fall 2025, PowMow includes this acreage in their headline acreage.",,Maybe,No,No,No
In-bounds,Auxilary Acreage,Disjoint skiable acreage that requires skiers to drive or take a bus to a distinct base area / tract of land / separate ski area.,"Some operators make a point of splitting this up into multiple designations (e.g. Aspen/Snowmass), while others often quote combined statistics across disjoint ski areas.",,Maybe,No,No,No
Out-of-Bounds,Permit Area / Broader Property,"Ski Areas often own, lease or have permission to operate on acreage well beyond their patrolled/administered boundary.  Often this will be designated with a ""special use permit"" or ""SUP"" boundary if they're on Forest Service land.  This terrain can include avalanche and terrain hazards and is typically unpatrolled and unmaintained.  This acreage can sometimes double or even dwarf the maintained/patrolled acres.  Sometimes this acreage can include guided cat skiing and/or popular ""sidecountry"" or hike-to terrain.  But it's the sort of terrain that requires exiting through a gate marked with a skull and crossbones, or ducking a rope.","When we independently measure ""boundary-to-boundary"" acreage for ski areas, we are often surprised to find resorts seemingly needing to include vast tracts of land beyond their patrolled boundaries.  This is mostly the case among western resorts, but their are eastern outliers as well.  A handful of resort websites explain this, but most do not.",,Maybe,No,No,No
